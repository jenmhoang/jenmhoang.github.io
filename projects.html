                                <a href="https://1951coffee.com/" target="_blank">1951 Coffee Company</a>, is a nonprofit organization that trains 
                                and employs recently resettled refugees/asylees in the Bay Area. Oftentimes, upon initial immigration, refugees are not given the proper support 
                                to attain living-wage jobs, as they face the challenges of language barriers and lack of resources. Through their Barista Training Program, 
                                1951 Coffee Company prepares over 100 refugees per year for entrance into the coffee industry, where they are able to maintain successful jobs.

                                nonprofit organizations. We aim to create in pursuit of a better world, through provision of accessible technology to in-need communities. 
                                Our project team consists of four developers (including myself), one designer, and one project leader.

                            The organization hosts Barista Training Programs throughout the year. Upon completion of the program, a Recruitment 
                            Specialist works with graduates to guide them through job opportunities and interview prep so that they can smoothly 
                            enter the coffee industry.

                        <h3>The Problem</h3>
                        <p>
                            <b>1951 Coffee Company does not have an proper organization or communication platform to efficiently run their program.</b> Any time there is an upcoming 
                            event or important message that needs to be relayed to the students, the program admins must manually type in the phone number of 
                            each individual trainee, sending the same text message to each participant in their program. The same tedious process occurs when the 
                            Recruitment Specialist reaches out to graduates regarding job opportunities, with the text message history acting as the only record of 
                            participants' job interests.
                        </p>

                    <div id="d1-t3">
                        <p>
                            Our team created a platform that provides access to community messaging, job opportunities, upcoming class events, and barista guides. 
                            This mobile application is offered on Android and iOS. As of now, the admin dashboard is built entirely on Airtable, where admins can 
                            manage users, send messages, and update information through various forms and tables. As the project progresses, we aim to build a separate webpage for 
                            admin usage.
                        </p>

                        <div class="row">

                                Admins can add new users through simple input of information onto Airtable. Usernames are automatically created with first name and last name inputs. 
                                Users can then log into their accounts through the admin-initialized usernames and passwords upon first opening the application.

                        Admin can send mass announcements and messages to multiple cohorts at a time. Users can respond to admins through embedded SMS messaging. Additional features include 
                        the ability to swipe to mark messages as read or unread and pull to refresh live message updates.

                                After graduating from a Barista Training Program, users will have access to a Jobs screen, where they can view job opportunities and indicate interest 
                                on the app. Their interest will be recorded on the admin dashboard, where the Recruitment Specialist will be notified and can help the graduate move forward 
                                with the job opportunity.

                                their corresponding events, from where they can view their own schedule as well as recommend future program events to friends.
