                                        Over the course of roughly four months, I worked with a team to create a React Native mobile application for a 1951 Coffee Company, 
                                        a non-profit organization with a refugee/asylee resettlement and education program. My team, all members of Blueprint, a tech 
                                        consulting organization for pro-bono software development, consisted of four developers (including myself), one designer, and one 
                                        project leader. This application allows admin and staff to efficiently communicate with the refugee community within their organization 
                                        and streamline the resettlement process, with provision of community messaging, upcoming events, job opportunities, and barista guides. 
                                        This is currently still an ongoing project; we just finished the MVP this December and are currently preparing it for user and admin handoff.

                                        Hello! I'm a sophomore UC Berkeley student who is passionate about software accessibility and the pursual of human rights; 
                                        I hope to use what I've learned as a <a href= "https://cs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science major</a> to develop technology that can advance public welfare and contribute to social good.
                                        I've also been exploring the world of Computer Graphics and 3D Design, where I aim to use my technical skills to automate and enhance graphical tools.
                                        <br><br>
                                        As a Software Developer for <a href="http://calblueprint.org/" target="_blank">Blueprint</a>, a tech consulting group that develops software pro-bono for nonprofit organizations, I am developing 
                                        a user-friendly application that streamlines the on-boarding process of <a href="https://1951coffee.com/" target="_blank">1951 Coffee Company</a>'s refugee resettlement and education program.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Additionally, I act as a class facilitator for the <a href="http://ucbugg.com/static/index.html" target="_blank">UC Berkeley Undergraduate Graphics Group</a>, where I teach students how to 
                                        navigate Autodesk Maya and perform each step of the 3D Animation pipeline.
