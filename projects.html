                        <p>
                            <a href="https://1951coffee.com/" target="_blank">1951 Coffee Company</a>, is a nonprofit organization that trains 
                            and employs recently resettled refugees/asylees in the Bay Area. Oftentimes, upon initial immigration, refugees are not given the proper support 
                            to attain living-wage jobs, as they face the challenges of language barriers and lack of resources. Through their Barista Training Program, 
                            1951 Coffee Company prepares over 100 refugees per year for entrance into the coffee industry, where they are able to maintain successful jobs.
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Team</h3>
                        <p>
                            <a href="http://calblueprint.org/" target="_blank">Blueprint</a> is a tech consulting organization that develops software pro-bono for 
                            nonprofit organizations. We aim to create in pursuit of a better world, through provision of accessible technology to in-need communities. 
                            Our team consists of four developers (including myself), one designer, and one project leader.
                        </p>

                            1951 Coffee Company hosts two-week barista training programs throughout the year. Upon completion of the program, a Recruitment 
                            Specialist works with graduates to guide them through job opportunities and interview prep so that they can smoothly 
                            enter the coffee industry.
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Problem</h3>
                        <p>
                            <b>The group does not have an proper organization or communication platform to efficiently run their program.</b> Any time there is an upcoming 
                            event or important message that needs to be relayed to the students, the program admins must manually type in the phone number of 
                            each individual trainee, sending the same text message to each participant in their program. The same tedious process occurs when the 
                            Recruitment Specialist reaches out to graduates regarding job opportunities, with the text message history acting as the only record of 
                            participants' job interests.
                        </p>

                            Our team created a platform that provides access to community messaging, job opportunities, upcoming class events, and barissta guides. 
                            This mobile application is compatible for Android and iOS. As of now, the admin dashboard is built entirely on Airtable, where admins can 
                            manage users, send messages, and update information through various forms and tables. As the project progresses, we aim to build a separate webpage for 
                            admin usage.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Users</h3>
                        <div class="info">
                            <p>
                                Admins can add new users through through simple input of information onto Airtable. Usernames are automatically created with first name and last name inputs. 
                                Users can then log into their accounts through the admin-initialized usernames and passwords upon first opening the application.
