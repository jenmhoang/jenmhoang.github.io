          <h2>Bezier Curves</h2>
          Bezier curves and surfaces are frequently used to model smooth and infinitely scalable curves and surfaces, and can be
          evaluated through the <b>de Casteljau</b> algorithm.
          <h3>The Algorithm</h3>
          Given n control points and a scalar parameter t ranging between 0 and 1, we can use linear interpolation to compute
          the n - 1 intermediate control points in the next subdivision level. An intermediate point p<sub>i</sub>' can be found
          through the following equation:
          <h5>p<sub>i</sub>' = (1 - t)p<sub>i</sub> + tp<sub>i + 1</sub></h5>
          I applied this step n - 1 times to obtain the resulting n - 1 intermediate control points in the next subdivision
          level. <br /><br />
          I continued applying this step successively to obtain the intermediate control points for each of the subdivision
          levels until one single point remained. This single point lies on the Bezier curve at the given parameter t.
          <br /><br />

          <h2>Bezier Surfaces</h2>
          The de Casteljau algorithm can also be used to evaluate Bezier surfaces. A Bezier surface is a parametric surface
          based on two parameters u and v, both ranging between 0 and 1. <br /><br />
          Given a n x m grid of control points, where each row of m control points defines a Bezier curve parameterized by u, I
          successively applied the de Casteljau algorithm to find the corresponding final point lying on each curve. Each of
          these obtained points for all n rows act as control points that define Bezier curves parameterized by v; I again
          successively applied the de Casteljau algorithm using these newly obtained control points to find a final point P that
          lies on the Bezier surface at the given parameter (u, v). <br /><br />

          <h2>Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h2>
          Here, I implemented area-weighted normal vectors at vertices. These vertex normals can be used for Phong shading,
          providing better shading for smooth surfaces. <br />
          <h3>Computing an area-weighted normal at a given vertex</h3>
          Using the half-edge data structure, I iterated through all triangle faces incident to the vertex, aggregating the
          cross product of two triangle edges for each face into a 3D Vector n. Then, to find the approximate unit normal at
          this vertex, I normalized the aggregate vector n of area-weighted normals. <br /><br />
          By using area-weighted normal vectors, we can achieve smoother gradient shading, improving the default flat shading of
          our low poly mesh. <br /><br />

          In this section, I implemented multiple local remeshing operations, including edge flipping, edge splitting, and mesh
          upsampling. <br /><br />
          <hr />
          <h2>Edge Flip</h2>
          <p>
            Given a pair of triangles (a, b, c) and (c, b, d), a flip operation on their shared edge (b, c) converts the
            original pair of triangles into a new pair (a, d, c) and (a, b, d)
          </p>
          <img style="width:80%" src="assets/meshedit/t4-1.png" />
          <h3>Implementation</h3>
          <p>
            In order to perform this operation, I first collected all involved edges, half-edges, vertices, and faces labeled in
            the "before" sketch below, before performing all necessary pointer reassignments for each element to match the
            assignments labeled in the "after" sketch.
          </p>
          <img style="width:80%" src="assets/meshedit/t4-2.png" />
          <p>
            I also added a check for whether either neighboring face of the edge is on a boundary loop; in this case, the edge
            should not be flipped.
          </p>
          <h3>Debugging</h3>
          A lot of the issues that I encountered during this implementation were a result of incorrect element
          collection/reassignment. After I ran into incorrect flips (half-edges pointing to the wrong vertices, etc), I created
          a table to organize each of the halfedge pointer assignments. After fixing my assignments, using this table as a
          reference, the edge flip operation ran smoothly.
          <img style="width: 30%" class="mImages" src="assets/meshedit/t4-3.png" />
          <h3>Results</h3>
          <p>Here is the edge flipping operation in action:</p>

          <hr />
          <h2>Edge Split</h2>
          Given a pair of triangles (a, b, c) and (c, b, d), a split operation on their shared edge (b, c) inserts a new vertex
          m at its midpoint and connects the new vertex to each opposing vertex a and d, yielding four triangles.
          <img style="width:80%" src="assets/meshedit/t5-1.png" />
          <h3>Implementation</h3>
          This implementation echoes that of the edge flip operation, only an edge split requires the addition of new mesh
          elements, including a new vertex positioned at the midpoint of the split edge, two new faces, three new edges, and six
          new halfedges. The necessary pointer reassignments are organized below.
          <img style="width:80%" src="assets/meshedit/t5-2.png" /> In order to avoid the issues I encountered earlier in my edge
          flip implementation due to incorrect pointer assignments, I organized pointer assignments beforehand, allowing the
          split operation to run smoothly at the first test run.

          <h2>Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h2>
          In order to convert a course polygon mesh into a higher-resolution one for better display, more accurate simulation,
          etc, we can use an upsampling algorithm that nicely interpolates/approximates the original mesh vertices.
          <b>Loop subdivision</b> upsamples a mesh by subdividing each of its triangles into four smaller triangles and updating
          all vertices of the subdivided mesh based on the weighted average of neighboring vertex positions.
          <img style="width:80%" src="assets/meshedit/t6-1.png" />
          <h3>Implementation</h3>

          <h4>Pre-computing vertex positions</h4>
          I started by pre-computing the positions of new vertices as a weighted average of old neighboring vertices. The
          updated position of an old vertex is
          <h5>(1 - n * u) * origPos + u * neighborSum</h5>
          where n is the vertex degree, u is a constant equal to 3/16 if n = 3 and 3/(8n) otherwise, origPos is the original
          position of the old vertex, and neighborSum is the sum of all original positions of the neighboring vertices.<br />
          <br />The position of a new vertex splitting the shared edge (A, B) between a pair of triangles (A, C, B) and (A, B,
          D) is
          <h5>(3/8) * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D)</h5>
          As I iterated through the vertices and edges, I flagged each element as old, which will be useful in the following
          series of split/fip operations.

          <h4>Splitting and Flipping</h4>
          Triangle subdivision can be done through a series of split and flip operations illustrated below.
          <img style="width:100%" src="assets/meshedit/t6-2.png" /> I split every original edge of the triangle, taking special
          care to avoid splitting newly added edges, which would result in infinite edge splitting. In the illustration, the
          target edges to be split are colored in blue. Any added elements that come about due to an edge split are flagged as
          new. <br /><br />Then, I flipped any new edge connecting an old vertex and a new vertex. In the illustration, the
          target edge to be flipped is colored in purple. <br />
          <br />
          Finally, after peforming these operations, I updated vertex positions to their precomputed values.

          <h3>Results</h3>
          Here is loop subdivision in action on a hand mesh: <br /><br />
          <div class="row" style="justify-content: center;">

          </div>
          <br />
          After performing loop subdivision, the sharp edges and corners of the affected mesh become smoothed out. This effect
          can be combatted by adding more edge loops closer to edges and corners. <br /><br />

            </div>
          </div>
          <br />
          The side of the cube that was pre-processed with additional edge loops has better preserved corners and edges.
          <br /><br />
          Additionally, as seen above, the default cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions due to the
          asymmetric manner of the edges splitting each cube face; thus the reassigned weighted vertex positions are unevenly
          weighted. In order to combat this, we can pre-process the cube with edge splits to make each face symmetric.
          <br /><br />
          <div class="row">
            <img class="mImages" src="assets/meshedit/t6-13.png" /> <img class="mImages" src="assets/meshedit/t6-14.png" />
            <img class="mImages" src="assets/meshedit/t6-15.png" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <br />
        Once all sides of cube are pre-processed to be symmetrical, loop subdivision upsamples the mesh symmetrically.
