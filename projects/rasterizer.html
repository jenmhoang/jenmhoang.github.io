          <h2>Diving into the Rasterization Pipeline</h2>
          <hr style="margin-top: 0;" />
          <p>
            In this project, I implemented the logic for some of the core
            aspects of the rasterization pipeline. I start with simple triangle
            rasterization, before working my way up into the implementation of
            anti-aliasing methods (through various sampling methods) and texture
            mapping.

          <h2>Rasterizing single-color triangles</h2>
          <div>
            Starting from the minimum x and y input triangle points to the
            maximum x and y input triangle points, I sampled each point at the
            center of each pixel within these bounds, checking whether or not
            the point was in the triangle or not. If it was, I filled in the
            pixel with the input color.
            <br /><br />
            <div class="row">
              <div style="margin-right: 50px;">
                I computed the line equation between some input triangle point
                P<sub>i</sub> and some other input triangle point
                P<sub>i+1</sub>, given by the following equation:
                <h5>
                  L<sub>i</sub>(x, y) = -(x - x<sub>i</sub>)(y<sub>i+1</sub> -
                  y<sub>i</sub>) + (y - y<sub>i</sub>)(x<sub>i+1</sub> -
                  x<sub>i</sub>)
                </h5>
                where x and y are the x and y coordinates of the sampled point.
                This equation is the dot product of V and N, where V is the line
                tangent vector between P<sub>i</sub> and the sampled point, and
                N is P<sub>i</sub>’s normal vector.
                <p>
                  If L<sub>i</sub>(x, y) >= 0 for all i in either clockwise or
                  counterclockwise order, the sampled point is considered inside
                  or on the edge of the triangle and is thus filled in with the
                  input color.

          <h2>Antialiasing triangles</h2>
          <h3>Supersampling</h3>
          <p>
            Supersampling is an anti-aliasing method done by sampling multiple
            locations within a pixel and averaging their values. Averaged color
            values contribute to smoother transitions along edges, reducing the
            appearance of jaggedness/pixelization (also known as “jaggies”).
          </p>
          <h3>Populating the Supersample Buffer</h3>
          <p>
            In my implementation of this method, I start by rasterizing a high
            resolution image to a supersample buffer, represented as a color
            vector that stores the rgb values of multiple subpixels within a
            pixel; the number of subpixels sampled per pixel is determined by
            the sample rate. The values stored in each subpixel is either an
            input color if the sampled subpixel is in the triangle, and the
            color white if it is not in the triangle.
          </p>
          <p>
            I initialized all values in the supersample buffer to the color
            white. Then, for every pixel within the bounds of the desired
            triangle’s min and max points, I sampled each subpixel, checking
            whether it was in the triangle or not. If the subpixel was in the
            triangle, I changed the value at its corresponding supersample
            buffer coordinate to be the input color.
          </p>
          <h3>Downsampling</h3>
          Once the supersample buffer was filled, the image needed to be
          downsampled to populate correct average values of the framebuffer. For
          every pixel within the bounds of the triangle’s min and max points, I
          computed the average color values of each one of its subpixels.

          <h2>Barycentric coordinates</h2>
          <h3>Barycentric Coordinates</h3>
          Barycentric Coordinates are a triangle coordinate system used to
          obtain smoothly varying values across a surface. These values are
          calculated through linear interpolation of values at the vertices of
          the triangle (which may denote position, color, texture coordinates,
          etc).
          <h3>Implementation</h3>
          In the following image, V<sub>A</sub>, V<sub>B</sub> and V<sub>C</sub>
          hold a red, green, and blue color values, respectively.
          <img src="../assets/rasterizer/t4-1.png" /> <br />
          <div>
            I found the colors at all points V by first calculating the alpha,
            beta, and lambda “weights,” where each scalar weights correspond to
            one vertex of the triangle. I then calculated the red, green, and
            blue values, which is equivalent to the sum of each of the color
            values of each vertex multiplied by its corresponding weight <br />
            (i.e. V.red = V<sub>A</sub>.red * alpha + V<sub>B</sub>.red * beta +
            V<sub>C</sub>.red * lambda).

          <h2>Pixel sampling for texture mapping</h2>
          <h3>Pixel Sampling</h3>
          When a texture is mapped to a triangle mesh, each (x, y) pixel
          location of the triangle is mapped to the corresponding "texel"
          location within the (u, v) coordinates of our texture image. To find
          the corresponding values, we use Barycentric Coordinates.
          <h3>Implementation</h3>
          Barycentric coordinates are implemented the same way as previously
          done, except now, the values being evaluated are pixel locations
          rather than rgb color values. Once the corresponding (u, v) values are
          calculated, we can choose to use either Nearest pixel sampling or
          Bilinear pixel sampling. Nearest pixel sampling simply samples the
          closest texel to the sampled point. Bilinear pixel sampling
          interpolates between the 4 nearest texels.
          <h3>Examples</h3>

          </div>
          <br />
          At a sample rate of 1, bilinear sampling produces a better image;
          because this method involves averaging 4 of the nearest texels, it’s
          able to capture more data about the original texture image, even if
          the texture has a higher frequency than the sample rate. Nearest
          sampling, on the other hand, may miss fine details that bilinear
          sampling would be able to preserve. At a sample rate of 16, there is
          less of a difference between the two sampling methods; because the
          frequency of the texture image is now closer to the sampling rate,
          less fine details may be missed using either method.

          <h2>Level sampling with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
          <h3>Level Sampling</h3>
          In the case where areas of our triangle mesh are at different depths
          in 3D space, we can apply level sampling to adjust the resolution
          depending on depth levels, where areas far away are downsampled and
          rendered at low resolutions and areas that are up close are rendered
          at higher resolutions. Application of level sampling can save
          computation time and filter minification.
          <h3>Types of Level Sampling</h3>
          Zero: sample all points at a depth level of 0 <br />Nearest: compute
          the nearest integer level <br />Linear: compute a weighted sum of
          levels
          <h3>Implementation</h3>
          I calculated the distance between the sampled point and its adjacent
          points; larger distances indicate that the sampled area is farther
          away, and is at a higher depth level. <br />
          I start by computing:
          <ul>
            <li>
              the Barycentric Coordinates of (x, y), (x + 1, y), and (x, y + 1)
            </li>
            <li>
              the (u, v) texel coordinates for each point, using the Barycentric
              Coordinates
            </li>
            <li>(du/dx), (dv/dx), (du/dy), and (dv/dy)</li>
          </ul>
          Then, I applied these values to the following equations:
          <img
            style="height: 100px; width: auto; padding: 10px 0;"
            src="../assets/rasterizer/t6-0.png"
          />
          From here, I can sample the texture map at the appropropriate depth
          level.
          <h3>Comparisons</h3>
          <b>Supersampling</b> has slower computation speed, increased memory
          usage, and greater anti-aliasing power. <br /><b>Bilinear sampling</b>
          compared to nearest sampling has slower computation speed, increased
          memory usage, and greater anti-aliasing power
          <br /><b>Level sampling</b> results in higher computation speed,
          increased memory usage, and greater anti-aliasing power.
