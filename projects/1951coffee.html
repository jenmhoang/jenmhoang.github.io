              >, is a nonprofit organization that trains and employs recently
              resettled refugees/asylees in the Bay Area. Oftentimes, upon
              initial immigration, refugees are not given the proper support to
              attain living-wage jobs, as they face the challenges of language
              barriers and lack of resources. Through their Barista Training
              Program, 1951 Coffee Company prepares over 100 refugees per year
              for entrance into the coffee industry, where they are able to
              maintain successful jobs.

            The organization hosts Barista Training Programs throughout the
            year. Upon completion of the program, a Recruitment Specialist works
            with graduates to guide them through job opportunities and interview
            prep so that they can smoothly enter the coffee industry.
          </p>
          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>
            <b
              >1951 Coffee Company does not have an proper organization or
              communication platform to efficiently run their program.</b
            >
            Any time there is an upcoming event or important message that needs
            to be relayed to the students, the program admins must manually type
            in the phone number of each individual trainee, sending the same
            text message to each participant in their program. The same tedious
            process occurs when the Recruitment Specialist reaches out to
            graduates regarding job opportunities, with the text message history
            acting as the only record of participants' job interests.

        <div id="dt3">
          <p>
            Our team created a platform that provides access to community
            messaging, job opportunities, upcoming class events, and educational
            resources. This mobile application is offered on Android and iOS
            through the App Store. The admin dashboard is built entirely on
            Airtable, where admins can manage users, send messages, and update
            information through various forms and tables.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h3>Users</h3>
          <p>
            Admins can add new users through simple input of information onto an
            Airtable database. Usernames are automatically created with first
            name and last name inputs. Users can then log into their accounts
            through the admin-initialized usernames and passwords upon first
            opening the application.

              src="../assets/1951/1951UserDashboard.png"
            />
          </div>
          <h3>Messaging</h3>
          <p>
            Admins can send mass announcements, event details, and messages to
            multiple cohorts at a time. Users can respond to admins through
            embedded SMS messaging.
          </p>

          <h3>Jobs</h3>
          <p>
            After graduating from a Barista Training Program, users will have
            access to a Jobs screen, where they can view job opportunities and
            indicate interest on the app. Their interest will be recorded on the
            admin dashboard, where the Recruitment Specialist will be notified
            and can help the graduate move forward with the job opportunity.
          </p>

          <h3>Classes</h3>
          <p>
            A large portion of participants within the program come from
            community referrals. The Classes screens allows users to view
            current and upcoming classes and their corresponding events, from
            where they can view their own schedule as well as recommend future
            program events to friends.
          </p>
          <h3>Resource Guide</h3>
          <p>
            The application also includes a Resources screen that includes class
            material that students could reference during or after their
            program. Resources include a barista brew guide, interview prep,
            coffee-making practice worksheets, and links to video tutorials. All
            resources are drawn from the Airtable database and can be easily
            updated and changed by admins.
