            The goal of our project is to simulate gradient light emission from
            heated metal objects. We will model how heat and the resulting glow
            varies over a surface, with consideration of material attributes.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h2>Problem Description</h2>
          <p>
            From the experiences that we've had applying glow attributes to
            models in 3D programs such as Autodesk Maya (used with Pixar
            RenderMan), we've found that the results fail to take into
            consideration material properties and variations in heat across a
            surface. Thus, they cannot be used to accurately represent objects
            that emit energy and glow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through this project, we aim to create functionality for a realistic
            representation of heated objects with diverse metal material
            properties. By doing so, we will demonstrate the different ways
            light emission can be simulated when considering the energy
            absorbance and reflectance properties of different materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using guidance from a few papers we are reading on, we plan to work
            through this problem by considering blackbody radiation models based
            on Kirchkoff's law.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
          <p>
            Through our analysis, we hope to gain understanding of how heat
            emittance varies between different materials and temperatures.
          </p>
          <h3>Quality and Performance</h3>
          <p>
            To measure the quality of our system, we will compare our renders to
            photographs of actually heated objects of different materials. To
            measure the performance of our system, we will compare the time it
            takes for a glowing object to light a scene against the time it
            takes for a typical light source to light a scene.
          </p>
          <h3>Plan to Deliver</h3>
          <p>
            We plan to deliver several images comparing the heated glows of at
            least three different metal materials. This can be done by
            considering the different energy absorbance/reflectance values of
            various materials that contribute to the resulting heat
            representation. We also plan on simulating the gradient glow of an
            object with non-uniform heat distribution (parts of the object are
            hotter or cooler than other parts). This can be done by
            interpolating glow gain values over a heat map.
          </p>
          <h3>Hope to Deliver</h3>
          <p>
            If we have extra time, we would like to consider how we might turn
            this into a plugin for a current existing 3D modeling or rendering
            software, such as Autodesk Maya.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, we hope to provide animated simulations of
            time-varying heat maps as the heat and corresponding glow of an
            object changes over time.
          </p>
          <h3>Interactivity</h3>
          <p>
            Our goal is for the program to take JSON files defining material
            attributes, PNG files acting as UV heat texture maps, and COLLADA
            (.dae) files defining 3D objects, and output a rendered PNG image.
          </p>

          <h3>Diffuse Blackbody Emission</h3>
          <p>
            We start by implementing the glow of perfectly diffuse emissive
            objects for some input temperature. In this case, our object is an
            ideal blackbody that absorbs and re-emits all energy falling upon
            it. We find the spectral radiance of our blackbody through Planck's
            law of black-body radiation.
          </p>
          <img style="width: 30%;" src="images/plancksEq.svg" />
          <p>
            Using this equation, we calculate a distribution of 81 discrete
            wavelengths ranging from 380 - 780 nm, roughly the human visual
            spectrum. Then, in order to compute a final color compatible with
            the computer display, we first convert the high dimensional spectrum
            to the three dimensional CIE 1931 XYZ color space, then apply a
            transformation matrix and gamma function to convert to sRGB.
          </p>

          <hr id="r" />
          <h3>Reflectance</h3>
          <p>
            In order to realistically render gradual changes in glow color as
            temperature varies, we combine our estimate of blackbody radiation
            with the microfacet-model reflectance of the metal. The final
            sampled color is a combination of reflected and emitted light,
            weighted by the absorbance factor of the material (1 - reflectance).
            Kirchoff's Law of Thermal Radiation ensures that the energy of the
            system is conserved, resulting in more realistic renders.
          </p>
          <h5 style="width: 70%; margin: auto;">
            Kirchoff's Law:
            <i
              >At thermal equilibrium, the emissivity and the absorptivity of a
              surface at a given temperature and wavelength are equal</i
            >
          </h5>

          <hr id="tr" />
          <h3>Test Renders</h3>
          <p>
            We used reflectance data from
            <a

              >this website</a
            >
            to estimate an average reflectance factor for each material (3D
            Shelf, 614 nm, 0° incidence). Our renders demonstrate
            temperature-responsive glow, direct illumination only (for now).

            s polarization and p polarization.

          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>
            So far we've modified the aforementioned quantities in a new BSDF
            class, called GlowingBSDF. We've also modified the estimation of
            global illumination by replacing the zero-bounce-radiance with the
            blackbody radiation weighted by the absorbance -- this allows us to
            simulate the glowing of the material.
          </p>

          <hr id="r2" />
          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            We're slightly behind the progress goals set in the proposal, but
            we've already produced some nice renders with the features
            implemented so far. We still have plenty of time to implement the
            most important features that remain.
          </p>

          <hr id="ns" />
          <h3>Next Steps</h3>
          <p>
            Right now, our renders only demonstrate the direct illumination of
            the glow effect. We will work on tracing multi-bounce paths to
            achieve global illumination. We also aim to render objects with
            non-uniform heat distributions by interpolating glow gain values
            over a heat map.

          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>
            From the experiences that we've had applying glow attributes to
            models in 3D programs such as Autodesk Maya (used with Pixar
            RenderMan), we've found that the results fail to take into
            consideration material properties and variations in heat across a
            surface. Thus, they cannot be used to accurately represent objects
            that emit heat/energy and glow.

          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p>
            For this project, we created functionality for a realistic
            representation of heated objects with diverse metal material
            properties. By doing so, we are able to demonstrate the different
            ways light emission can be simulated when considering the energy
            absorbance and reflectance properties of different materials. We
            also modeled how heat and the resulting glow could vary over a
            surface, by implementing volumetric temperature maps.

          <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
          <p>
            This project was built as an extension of the Project 3 Pathtracer
            codebase.
          </p>
          <h3>Diffuse Blackbody Emission</h3>
          <p>
            We start by implementing the glow of perfectly diffuse emissive
            objects for some input temperature. In this case, our object is an
            ideal blackbody that absorbs and re-emits all energy falling upon
            it. We compute the spectral radiance of our blackbody through
            Planck's law of black-body radiation.
          </p>
          <img style="width: 30%;" src="images/plancksEq.svg" />
          <p>
            Using this equation, we calculate a distribution of 81 discrete
            wavelengths ranging from 380 - 780 nm, roughly the human visual
            spectrum.
          </p>

          <img style="width: 70%;" src="images/distribution.png" />
          <h3>Reflectance</h3>
          <p>
            In order to control the glow attributes and inputs for different
            meshes, we create a GlowingBSDF class that expands on the microfacet
            model seen in Project 3. Here, we combine our estimate of blackbody
            radiation with the reflectance input of the metal, allowing us to
            realistically render changes in glow color as the temperature and
            metal material of our objects vary. The final sampled color is a
            combination of reflected and emitted light, weighted by the
            absorbance factor of the material (1 - reflectance). Kirchoff's Law
            of Thermal Radiation ensures that the energy of the system is
            conserved, resulting in more realistic renders.
          </p>
          <h5 style="width: 70%; margin: auto;">
            Kirchoff's Law:
            <i
              >At thermal equilibrium, the emissivity and the absorptivity of a
              surface at a given temperature and wavelength are equal</i
            >
          </h5>
          <h3>Color Reproduction</h3>
          <p>
            To compute a final color compatible with the computer display, we
            first convert the high dimensional spectrum to the three dimensional
            CIE 1931 XYZ color space, then apply a transformation matrix and
            gamma function to convert to sRGB.
          </p>
          <h3>Polarization of Light</h3>
          <p>
            Experimenting with the polarization of light and how that might
            enhance our glowing effect, we tested out both dielectric-dielectric
            and dielectric-conductor Fresnel terms split between both s and p
            polarization. In differentiating S (perpendicular) polarization and
            P (parallel) polarization, the electric field is either
            perpendicular or parallel to the plane of incidence -- the plane
            that contains the incident and reflected wave vectors.

          <h3>Ray Tracing Glowing Objects</h3>
          <p>
            To achieve both direct and global illumination, we altered the
            <i>get_emission</i> function of our GlowingBSDF class to return a
            radiance Spectrum based on the direction of the incoming light ray
            and the temperature at the point of ray intersection. This allows us
            to simulate the glowing effect while visually preserving the
            object’s dimensionality.
          </p>
          <h3>Volumetric Temperature Maps</h3>
          <p>
            Additionally, we modified our COLLADA parser, allowing it to read a
            temperature distribution tag that could process either a constant
            temperature, a linear gradient map, or a Perlin noise map. The code
            used to compute the Perlin noise function itself was found
            <a href="https://github.com/sol-prog/Perlin_Noise">here</a>, based
            on the
            <a href="https://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/paper445.pdf"
              >original paper</a
            >
            by Ken Perlin.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a constant temperature, we apply a uniform temperature
            distribution throughout the entire mesh, based on a scalar
            temperature input.
          </p>
          <p>
            For our linear gradient map, we obtain smoothly varying temperature
            values across the surface of our mesh through linear interpolation
            of two start and end temperature inputs at corresponding 3D vector
            positions.
          </p>
          <p>
            For our Perlin noise map, we apply the Perlin noise function to
            obtain a pseudo-random temperature distribution ranging between two
            input temperatures. Another input controls the noise fineness -- how
            quickly the temperatures fluxuate across 3D space.
          </p>

          <img style="width: 60%;" src="images/volume_distr.jpg" />

          <h3>Spectrum Caching</h3>
          <p>
            In order to improve program efficiency, we implemented a dynamic
            caching system that stored a map from integer-rounded temperatures
            to RGB Spectrums, reducing the amount of computation needed for
            repeated temperature samples.
          </p>
          <p>
            No loss in image quality was detectible due to rounded temperature
            samples, as the bucket size is very small in comparison to the wide
            range of possible temperatures. Further research could determine the
            effectiveness of larger and/or adaptive bucket sizes, as greater
            temperature gaps are required to produce a visual difference in
            emission as overall temperature increases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using our caching system, slight but consistent improvements in
            render speed were observed with a variety of models, materials,
            sampling rates, and temperature distributions.

          <h2>Problems Encountered</h2>
          <h3>Out-of-gamut colors for low temperatures (&lt;2000K)</h3>
          <p>
            We were not initially able to reproduce the reddish emission color
            of objects heated to temperatures less than about 2000K, instead
            producing a range of strange pink hues. Converting from CIE XYZ to
            sRGB, we found that the resulting Spectrum sometimes contained a red
            value greater than 1, and a blue value less than 0. By clamping
            these values to the range 0 through 1, as required by the Spectrum
            class, this problem was fixed.
          </p>

          <img style="width: 60%;" src="images/bunnyLowTempError.png" />

          <h3>Ray Tracer Modifications</h3>
          <p>
            Our first attempt at ray tracing glowing objects didn’t work without
            external lighting, as the path tracer was importance sampling only
            light objects for one-bounce illumination. Also, zero-bounce
            illumination was only capable of returning a constant radiance from
            a BSDF, with no dependence on ray direction or intersection
            position. At this time, we only had access to Project 3-2 code, so
            we couldn’t directly change these aspects of the path tracer code.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our second attempt, we ported in Project 3-1 code and changed the
            zero-bounce radiance code and our GlowingBSDF
            <i>get_emission</i> function to return a direction and position
            dependent emission. This blackbody emission was multiplied by an
            average absorbance factor, as described in the paper. We also
            altered our code to use cosine hemisphere sampling so the glowing
            objects could produce global illumination.
          </p>
          <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
          <p>
            Alongside overcoming the problems we encountered in the previous
            section, we learned a lot about the physics behind glowing objects,
            from blackbody radiation and Kirchoff’s Law to polarization.
            Applying the concepts we learned in the color reproduction lectures
            really helped us understand the computational representations of
            color.
          </p>
          <p>
            Going through the project, we also strengthened our understanding of
            how the Project 3 Codebase worked, from following an XML file
            through the Collada Parser, to ray-tracing and incorporating the
            BSDF functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            This process also familiarized us with working in a team across
            Github and XCode -- from fixing small linker issues to modifying the
            Cmake List and rebuilding when we create new files. It was
            interesting to go through iterations on our project -- dropping by
            office hours when we got really stuck and going back to edit the
            code to work with advice we’d received.
