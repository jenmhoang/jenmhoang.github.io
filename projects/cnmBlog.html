        <h3>October 16</h3>

        <p>This week, I met up with some other teammates to collaborate on the animatic and talk through our current
          storyboards. We made sketches and comments on a jamboard to make a concrete animatic plan before splitting up
          storyboard tasks. I drew a sequence of storyboards that depicted the interaction between the man and the
          mirage.</p>

        <h3>October 9</h3>

        <p>With the rest of the team, we talked about how we could modify the animatic to evoke the emotions that the
          story intends. In order to do this, we drafted updated storyboards that provided more POV shots and
          highlighted emotions on the main character's face. This week, I drew a sequence of boards that showed the main
          character reaching towards the mirage's hand before passing through it (from a POV angle). Additionally, I
          colored in one of the expression sheet sketches to map out the coloring / facial featuers of the main
          character.</p>

        <h3>October 4</h3>

        <p>I continued working on character design with the rest of the team, primarily considering the costuming, body
          type, and ethnic influences for the two characters. Then, once we pinned down our visual pursuits, I iterated
          on the character expression sheets that I made last time. For this sheet, I included various expressions of
          sadness at varying levels of intensity and nuance.</p>

        <h3>October 2</h3>

        <p>This week, I worked on the character design, and discussed some of the key features of the protagonist with
          the team. We also talked about the symbolism/intended feelings that the designs are meant to invoke. I then
          drew the character expression sheets for the main character.</p>
