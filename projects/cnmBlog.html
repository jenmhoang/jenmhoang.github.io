          <h3>December 4</h3>
          <p>
            After so many iterations of the animatic, it had become a
            combinations of many artists' different styles. The team decided
            that the board needed clean-up and visual tweaking, in a consistent
            art style for cohesiveness. Thus, I spent this week drawing a
            majority of the updated storyboards (44 total boards, not including
            re-iterations and feedback cycles).

          <h3>November 20</h3>
          <p>
            This week, I shifted focus over to shading and Substance Painter. I
            started looking into scripting for Substance Painter -> Maya
            workflows and found that Substance Painter had a pretty
            well-documented scripting API to create plugins in python and
            JavaScript. I plan on continuing to explore ways to speed up the
            Substance Painter -> Maya process over the weekend. In the meantime,
            I've also made UV maps and textures for a simple flower pot model
            that attempts to imitate a terracotta material. I plan on continuing
            to iterate on this, as some of the bumpy texture still looks out of
            place and I would like to modify the damages/chipped indents to
            areas that would make more sense (edges, etc).

          <h3>November 13</h3>
          <p>
            This week, I continued to struggle with Houdini / simulations. After
            a series of crashes/failed attempts, I shifted to compiling style
            resources for disintegration inspiration (which also included
            tutorials/demos) for me to test. I plan on cleaning my laptop and
            continuing to try Houdini simulations -- otherwise, if I else fails,
            I will probably swap simulation tasks with someone else who can run
            Houdini smoothly and take on Maya simulations instead (not sure why
            Houdini is giving me such a hard time). Until then, most of what I
            have are just crash logs :(

          <h3>November 6</h3>
          <p>
            This week was a lot less fruitful than the previous weeks, as I ran
            into multiple issues regarding simulation tests. I tried to work
            through Houdini/Maya integration to establish a strong workflow
            between the two, but ran into licensing issues that restricted
            integration. I spent some time trying out workarounds to no avail.
            After failing to integrate Houdini, I went back to Maya simulation
            testing as a backup. I created an emission map image sequence in
            After Effects with turbulence/noise to control the changing opacity
            of the mesh. While I was able to attach the image sequence to a
            lambert shader, I wasn't able to attach it to a PxrSurface material
            without Maya crashing or freezing. After many failed attempts, I
            took a break from disintegration effects and started exploring hair
            sim. No tests on hair sim yet, but have been researching / watching
            videos / gathering resources. Because many of the simulation tests
            were failed attempts, I don't have another simulation sample test to
            show, but I have the emission map sequence that I tried assigning,
            shown here:

          <h3>October 30</h3>
          <p>
            This week, I spent a lot of time working with simulations. In both
            Maya and Houdini, I spent time further exploring how disintegration
            and sandstorm simulation should look. I ran an nParticles test in
            Maya to visualize disintegration, which I plan to layer with the
            texture/emission maps applied to the objects' shaders to give an
            illusion of disintegration without actually modifying the geometry.

          <h3>October 23</h3>
          <p>
            This week, I transitioned from animatic work (sketched some boards
            that never main it into the end product) to simulation research and
            testing.

          />
          <p>
            First, I researched different methods of simulating
            dust/sand/disintegration together with Ethan and compiled some
            resources onto the
            <a
              href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oJ6JAyn6HtdwPF-PasPb5KClpRUkmlc0A8_vVT0NEvQ/edit#slide=id.g9d33cf32f8_0_1"
              >simulation slidedeck</a
            >. Then, I tried a couple of them out to test out dust effects using
            Maya fluids. I started the early stages of a disintegration test,
            where I animated transparency maps across an object to test how we
            can control where the mesh would disappear. The next stages would be
            to translate the shape of the object into particles (probably will
            test with nParticles) and have those particles move in line with the
            transparency map. I also compiled a style moodboard to figure out
            what kind of disintegration effect we wanted to pursue and discussed
            our different options with the rest of the team.

          <h3>October 16</h3>

          <p>
            This week, I met up with some other teammates to collaborate on the
            animatic and talk through our current storyboards. We made sketches
            and comments on a jamboard to make a concrete animatic plan before
            splitting up storyboard tasks. I drew a sequence of storyboards that
            depicted the interaction between the man and the mirage.

          <h3>October 9</h3>

          <p>
            With the rest of the team, we talked about how we could modify the
            animatic to evoke the emotions that the story intends. In order to
            do this, we drafted updated storyboards that provided more POV shots
            and highlighted emotions on the main character's face. This week, I
            drew a sequence of boards that showed the main character reaching
            towards the mirage's hand before passing through it (from a POV
            angle). Additionally, I colored in one of the expression sheet
            sketches to map out the coloring / facial featuers of the main
            character.

          <p>
            I continued working on character design with the rest of the team,
            primarily considering the costuming, body type, and ethnic
            influences for the two characters. Then, once we pinned down our
            visual pursuits, I iterated on the character expression sheets that
            I made last time. For this sheet, I included various expressions of
            sadness at varying levels of intensity and nuance.

          <h3>October 2</h3>

          <p>
            This week, I worked on the character design, and discussed some of
            the key features of the protagonist with the team. We also talked
            about the symbolism/intended feelings that the designs are meant to
            invoke. I then drew the character expression sheets for the main
            character.
