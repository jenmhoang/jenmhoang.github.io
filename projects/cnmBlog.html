          <h3>April 9</h3>
          <p>
            This week, I iterated on the shot2->3 animations. I made them more
            continuous, adjusted the stumble in shot2, and added more
            blendshapes/eye darts in shot3. Additionally, I lit shots 1 and 3.

            On this next iteration of Jon's shot2 animation, he is still for a
            moment before stumbling back. Here, his movements are more refined
            (additional stumble, more wind push-back, hand curling).
            Additionally, there are more blinks/facial expressions keyed in (his
            mouth opens at some points but his lips look the same color as the
            inside of his mouth right now, so it's hard to tell!).

            I continued iterating on the shot2 animation of Jon. Now, he
            stumbles back to react to the sand before pushing against the wind
            with his steps forward. I also sent it for crit to the team, and
            will work on slowing down the stumble / making it more subtle, based
            on feedback.

            I iterated on the shot2 animation of Jon. In the newest iterations,
            I exaggerated Jon's poses and gave him more movement. While I don't
            have a ready playblast (I had movement in progress, but the poses
            have been continually changing with discussion that now the movement
            is now awkward), but I have screenshots of new poses.

            I was able to work past the Houdini problems that I encountered last
            week (after some help from my team and multiple trials). Then I
            worked on the animation for the first few shots of the short, where
            I will also be adding in the petals/wind simulation that I had been
            working on before. Here's one of my shots in progress, where I
            modified the first shot of Jon in the desert to better reflect the
            intention for his emotions (sighing 'dammit im here in this sad
            mental state again' instead of shocked and looking around).

            This week, I tried continuing to work on Houdini sims, but was
            blocked by licensing issues when attempting to switch to the
            educational license. I am not able to open/use Houdini now that the
            licensing failed. I believe the problem might be happening on my end
            rather than the server's end. Between my multiple tries, I've been
            meaning to get help from Ali, but have been honestly really
            busy/distracted by other classes this week. I will try again to fix
            it this weekend, and send messages if it still does not work!

          <h3>February 26</h3>
          <p>
            This week, I continued working on the petals/wind simulation in
            Houdini. It took me a while to adjust the parameters to look correct
            (a correct balance between object density and wind force) because I
            initially had the geometry scaled incorrectly. Then, I set the
            camera and the petals to imitate Jon's POV.

          <p>
            This week, I shifted from 2d animatic / blendshape work over to
            Houdini simulation, using the Educational License. I spent some time
            at the beginning of the week following Houdini basics/fundamentals
            videos to get a better understanding of how to navigate the UI
            (because despite playing around with it last semester, it was still
            pretty intimidating). Then, I focused on the flower petals / wind
            sim (for the scene where flower petals fly from Lila to Jon). First,
            I started by copying a single petal model to multiple points at
            randomized angles/size, then simulating this group of petals to fall
            to the ground (to create a pile of petals, with the intention of
            having the wind blow these petals off the ground). Then I started
            trying to direct the wind movement. Initial attempts of this failed
            (Houdini error pictures attached), but I will continue working
            through the errors.

          <p>
            This week, I updated Lila's blendshapes for her happy emotions. This
            included refining the eyebrow movement, modifying her lip placement
            during smiles (the lips more stretched out horizontally, I moved the
            edges of the lips inwards, I moved the lips in to sit against her
            teeth instead of sticking out in front). Additionally, I added
            details to the way the rest of her space responds to her smile
            (substle indents/dimples above the corners of her mouth, stretch the
            nose/mouth area outwards as, moved her cheekbones and under-eyes
            up).

          <p>
            This week, I worked on updating the 2d animatic, by modifying old
            boards so that they followed the Rule of Thirds (eliminating awkward
            composition) and so that the boards maintained Jon on the left side
            of the boards, and Lila on the right. Then, I drew more boards that
            visualized the interaction between Jon and Lila. Here are some
            over-the-shoulder test shots that ended up not being used in the
            animatic.

          <p>
            This week, I worked on refining the blendshapes for Lila. I focused
            on creating facial expressions of shock (not sure if this would be
            used, but just played with the facial movement just in case), a more
            reserved, calm happy/sad (similar to what it would be when she looks
            as Jon as she is disappearing), and an excited happiness (first
            encounter/sight of Jon). I still need to continue working on the
            smile (right now, the lips aren't as stretched, and they swell too
            much during her open-mouth smile).

          <p>
            After so many iterations of the animatic, it had become a
            combinations of many artists' different styles. The team decided
            that the board needed clean-up and visual tweaking, in a consistent
            art style for cohesiveness. Thus, I spent this week drawing a
            majority of the updated storyboards (44 total boards, not including
            re-iterations and feedback cycles).

          <p>
            This week, I shifted focus over to shading and Substance Painter. I
            started looking into scripting for Substance Painter -> Maya
            workflows and found that Substance Painter had a pretty
            well-documented scripting API to create plugins in python and
            JavaScript. I plan on continuing to explore ways to speed up the
            Substance Painter -> Maya process over the weekend. In the meantime,
            I've also made UV maps and textures for a simple flower pot model
            that attempts to imitate a terracotta material. I plan on continuing
            to iterate on this, as some of the bumpy texture still looks out of
            place and I would like to modify the damages/chipped indents to
            areas that would make more sense (edges, etc).

          <p>
            This week, I continued to struggle with Houdini / simulations. After
            a series of crashes/failed attempts, I shifted to compiling style
            resources for disintegration inspiration (which also included
            tutorials/demos) for me to test. I plan on cleaning my laptop and
            continuing to try Houdini simulations -- otherwise, if I else fails,
            I will probably swap simulation tasks with someone else who can run
            Houdini smoothly and take on Maya simulations instead (not sure why
            Houdini is giving me such a hard time). Until then, most of what I
            have are just crash logs :(

          <h3>November 6</h3>
          <p>
            This week was a lot less fruitful than the previous weeks, as I ran
            into multiple issues regarding simulation tests. I tried to work
            through Houdini/Maya integration to establish a strong workflow
            between the two, but ran into licensing issues that restricted
            integration. I spent some time trying out workarounds to no avail.
            After failing to integrate Houdini, I went back to Maya simulation
            testing as a backup. I created an emission map image sequence in
            After Effects with turbulence/noise to control the changing opacity
            of the mesh. While I was able to attach the image sequence to a
            lambert shader, I wasn't able to attach it to a PxrSurface material
            without Maya crashing or freezing. After many failed attempts, I
            took a break from disintegration effects and started exploring hair
            sim. No tests on hair sim yet, but have been researching / watching
            videos / gathering resources. Because many of the simulation tests
            were failed attempts, I don't have another simulation sample test to
            show, but I have the emission map sequence that I tried assigning,
            shown here:

          <p>
            This week, I spent a lot of time working with simulations. In both
            Maya and Houdini, I spent time further exploring how disintegration
            and sandstorm simulation should look. I ran an nParticles test in
            Maya to visualize disintegration, which I plan to layer with the
            texture/emission maps applied to the objects' shaders to give an
            illusion of disintegration without actually modifying the geometry.

          <p>
            This week, I transitioned from animatic work (sketched some boards
            that never main it into the end product) to simulation research and
            testing.

          />
          <p>
            First, I researched different methods of simulating
            dust/sand/disintegration together with Ethan and compiled some
            resources onto the
            <a
              href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oJ6JAyn6HtdwPF-PasPb5KClpRUkmlc0A8_vVT0NEvQ/edit#slide=id.g9d33cf32f8_0_1"
              >simulation slidedeck</a
            >. Then, I tried a couple of them out to test out dust effects using
            Maya fluids. I started the early stages of a disintegration test,
            where I animated transparency maps across an object to test how we
            can control where the mesh would disappear. The next stages would be
            to translate the shape of the object into particles (probably will
            test with nParticles) and have those particles move in line with the
            transparency map. I also compiled a style moodboard to figure out
            what kind of disintegration effect we wanted to pursue and discussed
            our different options with the rest of the team.

          <h3>October 16</h3>

          <p>
            This week, I met up with some other teammates to collaborate on the
            animatic and talk through our current storyboards. We made sketches
            and comments on a jamboard to make a concrete animatic plan before
            splitting up storyboard tasks. I drew a sequence of storyboards that
            depicted the interaction between the man and the mirage.

          <h3>October 9</h3>

          <p>
            With the rest of the team, we talked about how we could modify the
            animatic to evoke the emotions that the story intends. In order to
            do this, we drafted updated storyboards that provided more POV shots
            and highlighted emotions on the main character's face. This week, I
            drew a sequence of boards that showed the main character reaching
            towards the mirage's hand before passing through it (from a POV
            angle). Additionally, I colored in one of the expression sheet
            sketches to map out the coloring / facial featuers of the main
            character.

          <p>
            I continued working on character design with the rest of the team,
            primarily considering the costuming, body type, and ethnic
            influences for the two characters. Then, once we pinned down our
            visual pursuits, I iterated on the character expression sheets that
            I made last time. For this sheet, I included various expressions of
            sadness at varying levels of intensity and nuance.

          <h3>October 2</h3>

          <p>
            This week, I worked on the character design, and discussed some of
            the key features of the protagonist with the team. We also talked
            about the symbolism/intended feelings that the designs are meant to
            invoke. I then drew the character expression sheets for the main
            character.
